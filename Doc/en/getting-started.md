## **2. Accessing the Modules**

After logging in, Shifin can see a list of modules in the left sidebar. These modules are assigned based on the user's role and permissions. For instance, Shifin might have access to **Sales**, **Finance**, and **Inventory** modules.

> **Note:** If Shifin cannot see any modules in the left sidebar, they should contact the system administrator to ensure the correct modules are assigned.

**Example:**
- **Shifin** logs in and immediately sees the **Sales**, **Finance**, and **Inventory** modules on the left sidebar.
